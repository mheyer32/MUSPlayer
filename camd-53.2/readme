camd.library 53.2				June 2012

This update is a major rewrite of camd.library.
Before this release, camd has been a port of the
AROS version of this library. This new version
is completely OS4 native. While still based on
the code provided by Kjetil Mattheusen, it now
has shed the AROS lib headers and conditional
branches, It has also been migrated to the modern
variable types, had most of the list handling
updated, and no longer links with _USE_INLINE_
defined.

The resulting library is about 60% of it's 
previous size, and includes a few minor bug fixes
as well.

With a re-write of this magnitude just completed,
we may have picked up a few bugs in the library.
Please contact me with any issues so that we can 
keep the updates in order.

This library has been tested with USB and Gameport
MIDI interfaces, it has also been tested with 68K
CAMD apps and appears to be working fine.

Previous versions offered, but did not support
notification for member changes within a cluster.
Signal notification is now supported, and callback
hooks for the same will be added soon.

Apparently SoftSyn was the first app to try and 
use that feature. As a result, 53.2 is the minimum
library version for SoftSyn support.

camd.library 50.8				November 06, 2008

This update fixes a problem that occurred when the opening task
would exit, if joyport MIDI interfaces were opened by that task. 
(Thanks Andy!) Also now allows calling ICamd->RemoveMidiLink() 
and ICamd->DeleteMidi() with null arguments, which was 
documented but never supported.

No changes to dev kit. It is the same as it was in 50.6

camd.library 50.6                               July 1, 2007

This update fixes a problem when flushing the library.
Also has an improved installer script.
No other known issues at this time.

If this is your first install of CAMD, you'll need to add drivers
for your MIDI port(s). Drivers are available for:
EMU10Kx  (Soundblaster)
ENVY24HT (Phase28 and ESI Juli())
VIA686   (AmigaOne builtin) (MIDI_OUT only)
USB      (class compliant USB MIDI devices)

All of these are available at OS4Depot
http://os4depot.net/index.php?function=browse&cat=driver/misc

camd.library 50.5				February 05, 2006

This update fixes a problem with QuerySysEx() that could
affect receiving System Exclusive messages properly.
Also added are fixes for GetMidiAttrsA(), and a complete
rewrite of NextMidiLink(). This corrects all the bugs
that have been reported at this time.
This version also includes an install script, and all the
files necessary for developers to write for CAMD.

I have decided to package the Emu10KX driver separately,
since there are many different drivers available now.

camd.library 50.2				June 11, 2005

camd.library is code to connect MIDI applications
with each other and external controllers, synthesizers,
sampling devices, and musical effects. 

This is an update of the camd.library for OS4.
This update fixes a bug in PutSysEx(). It also
adds StartClusterNotify() and EndClusterNotify(),
adds support for cable messages, and cleans up 
a few details.

To install, simply copy camd.library to your libs:
directory. Then copy whatever drivers suit your
system to devs:midi. The driver for emu10k based 
sound cards is included, with source. A output-only 
driver for the onboard via chipset on a Micro-A1 is 
available from OS4Depot.net. More drivers may
be available in the future.

If you install the included emu10kx driver, see the
install help file for more information.

If you are updating a working installation, just copy
the new library to libs: and reboot.

Also included are the necessary files for developers
wishing to write tools for camd. To use these, you'll
need to install the OS4 SDK first, then open the
camdincl.lha file and specify SDK: as the destination.
The files will be installed in various places in your
sdk:local directory.
The autodoc is in SDK:Local/documents/AutoDoc/camd.doc

Original AROS source by  Kjetil Matheussen. 

Original readme follows
****************************************************************

This is the first port of CAMD (Commodore Amiga MIDI Device)
for OS4 native. It is based on the AROS source, but has a change
to the drivers, which makes it incompatible to old drivers.
The old drivers were 68k exe's which were abused as libraries.
I had to change this madness to proper libraries in order to
get it to work and to have a cleaner solution. On classics you
can still use the 68k camd library with the camd.l.main glue file.

The first CAMD native driver for the emu10kx gameport is also
included.

It has been quite an effort to port, and I guess also for the original
effort by Kjetil Matheussen, by reverse engineering CAMD and making
it into proper C code for AROS.

I intend to send the source code changes back to Kjetil ASAP, but
right now it needs some cleaning up before that. Source of the
emu10kx CAMD driver is included, although you'll also need the
accompanying emu10kx AHI driver code for it to work/compile.

Note: OpenMidiDevice() is not supported anymore, which shouldn't
be a problem.
